# Dokki Workspace — Browse, Search, Organize & Connect

This skill drives the `find`, `edit`, `share`, `message`, `create`, and `connect` facades. Every
call is `<facade> {action, <top-level ids>, args:{…}}`. Facades are self-teaching: call one with
**no `action`** to list its actions, and dangerous actions return a `confirm_token` you re-send to
execute.

## Mode Decision Tree

Determine which mode the user is in:

```
User request
│
├── "Show me / what's in / list…"                    → BROWSE
├── "Find / search / where is / look up / related"    → SEARCH
├── "Ask / notify / confirm with a teammate"          → CHANNEL
├── "Connect / pull from / push to <external app>"    → CONNECT
└── "Move / rename / tag / share / delete / organize" → ORGANIZE
```

If ambiguous, ask before acting.

---

## BROWSE Mode

### Workflow

1. `find {action:"workspaces"}` — Get all workspaces authorized for this MCP connection with
   roles. Results include `org_id`, `org_name`, and `org` for Org workspaces; Personal
   workspaces have `org_id: null`.
2. If user has only one workspace → use it directly. Otherwise group by Personal/Org
   and ask or match by name. If names collide, include the Org name in the choice.
3. `find {action:"resources", workspace_id}` → Get the tree. Pass `args.filter {tags, type, dates}`
   to return a flat, filtered list instead of the full tree.

### Output Template

```
Personal
└── <workspace-name> (role: admin, id: a1b2c3d4)

Org: <org-name> (<org-id-prefix>)
└── <workspace-name> (role: editor, id: e5f6g7h8)

📁 Projects/
├── 📄 PRD v2 (a1b2c3d4)
├── 📊 Roadmap (e5f6g7h8)
└── 📁 Archive/
    └── 📄 Old spec (i9j0k1l2)
📄 README (m3n4o5p6)
🎨 Dashboard (q7r8s9t0)

Total: 3 documents, 1 table, 1 artifact, 2 folders
```

Icons: 📄 document, 📊 table, 🎨 artifact, 📁 folder

### Pitfalls

- `find {action:"resources"}` only returns non-archived resources
- IDs shown to the user should be short (8-char prefix) — full UUIDs are visually noisy
- If the user has many workspaces (>5), don't dump the full tree of all of them; ask which one
- `find {action:"workspaces"}` is scoped by the current MCP connection. If an expected Org or
  workspace is missing, tell the user to reconnect OAuth and select that scope, or use the
  correct Org-scoped API key. Do not ask them to change the server URL to an Org-specific endpoint.

## SEARCH Mode

### Pick the right search action

| Action | Use when | Matches on |
|--------|----------|-----------|
| `find {action:"search", args:{query}}` | **First choice.** Question-style / conceptual lookups ("what's our refund policy?") | Meaning (hybrid semantic + keyword) |
| `find {action:"grep", args:{pattern, regex?}}` | You need an **exact** string, code token, identifier, or regex | Literal text / regex, line-level excerpts |
| `find {action:"related", args:{query}}` | User asks how people, companies, products, places, or concepts connect | Knowledge graph entities and relationships |

Default to `find {action:"search"}`. Reach for `find {action:"grep"}` only when the user wants a
precise literal match (a function name, error string, exact phrase). Use `find {action:"related"}`
for relationship mapping, not content lookup.

### Workflow

1. Transform natural language question into a keyword-rich query:
   - "What's our refund policy?" → `"refund policy terms conditions"`
   - "How does auth work?" → `"authentication flow architecture login"`
   - Combine entity names with structural keywords (summary, timeline, spec)
2. Call `find {action:"search", args:{query, limit?}}` (optionally with a top-level `workspace_id`),
   or `find {action:"grep", args:{pattern, regex?}}` for exact/regex matches
3. If results are weak, reformulate with different angles and run again
4. To scan a single hit before a full `read {action:"doc"}`, use `preview_resource {resource_id}`
5. For "how is X related to Y?" or "what do we know around X?", call
   `find {action:"related", args:{query}}` and then read the most relevant returned resources.

### Query Strategy

| Question style | Limit | Tip |
|----------------|-------|-----|
| Specific lookup ("Where is X?") | 5-10 | Narrow query, entity name + type |
| Broad exploration ("What do we have on Y?") | 20-30 | Multiple keyword combinations |
| Exact string / identifier / regex | — | Use `find {action:"grep"}`, not `find {action:"search"}` |
| Multi-hop ("Find X then find things mentioning it") | Iterate | Run multiple searches, synthesize |

### Output Template

```
🔍 "<query>" — N results

1. 📄 **PRD v2** (a1b2c3d4, score: 0.91)
   > …relevant excerpt highlighting the match…

2. 📄 **Design Spec** (e5f6g7h8, score: 0.84)
   > …
```

### Pitfalls

- Don't dump raw search results — summarize and pick the most relevant
- The user usually wants an *answer*, not a list of links. Read top hits with
  `read {action:"doc", resource_id}` (delegate to `dokki-document`) and synthesize if the intent
  is "find out what X is"
- Search and grep results include absolute in-app `url` fields. Cite hits as markdown links
  like `[Title](https://dokki.one/...)`, not raw IDs.

---

## CHANNEL Mode

Use the `message` facade when the user wants to notify people, ask for approval,
or wait for a teammate's answer before continuing.

### Workflow

1. Resolve the `workspace_id`. If needed, call `find {action:"workspaces"}`.
2. If addressing a person by name, call `message {action:"members", workspace_id}` first to
   identify members.
3. Call `message {action:"send", workspace_id, args:{content, require_response?}}` with clear
   text. Set `require_response: true` when waiting for approval or an answer.
4. Call `message {action:"read", workspace_id, args:{limit?}}` to check recent replies before
   proceeding.

### Pitfalls

- Messages are posted as the authenticated Dokki user.
- For destructive or visible actions, wait for an explicit reply before continuing.
- Keep the message self-contained: what you plan to do, what answer you need, and any
  resource links or short IDs.

---

## CONNECT Mode

Dokki's MCP is a **gateway to 1000+ external integrations** (via Composio: GitHub, Slack, Gmail,
Notion, Google Sheets/Drive/Calendar, Linear, and more). Use CONNECT when the user wants to pull
data from — or push data to — a system outside Dokki. Connections are **user-scoped**: the user
authorizes their own accounts *through* Dokki once, and every skill can then read/write them.

### Action Matrix

| Step | Facade call | Notes |
|------|-------------|-------|
| Discover integrations | `connect {action:"apps", args:{query?, limit?}}` | Search the 1000+ toolkits; each result's `slug` is what you pass as `toolkit` to `authorize` |
| See what's connected | `connect {action:"list"}` | Your accounts + their status |
| Authorize a new one | `connect {action:"authorize", args:{toolkit:"github"}}` | Returns an OAuth `authorize_url` (or an API-key form); open it, then poll `list` until active |
| Disconnect | `connect {action:"disconnect", args:{connection_id}}` | Remove one account |
| List callable tools | `connect {action:"tools", args:{toolkit?}}` | The tools your connections expose |
| Run a tool | `connect {action:"call", args:{tool, args}}` | The relay executes it and returns the result |

### Workflow

1. `connect {action:"list"}` — check whether the needed toolkit is already connected.
2. If not, `connect {action:"authorize", args:{toolkit}}` → give the user the returned
   `authorize_url` to open, then poll `connect {action:"list"}` until it reports active.
3. `connect {action:"tools", args:{toolkit}}` to find the right tool name for the task.
4. `connect {action:"call", args:{tool, args}}` to fetch or push the data.
5. Route the result into Dokki — `create {action:"table"}` (structured) or
   `create {action:"doc"}` (narrative). This is the **External Data → Dokki** flow.

### Pitfalls

- Connections are per-user, not per-workspace — authorizing once covers every workspace.
- Never fabricate a `tool` name; always discover it via `connect {action:"tools"}` first.
- `authorize` doesn't complete the connection — the user must finish OAuth in the browser, and
  you must poll `list` until it's active before calling tools.
- If `COMPOSIO_API_KEY` isn't configured on the server, `connect` fails soft — tell the user
  integrations aren't enabled rather than retrying.

## ORGANIZE Mode

### Action Matrix

| Action | Facade call | Key params | Risk |
|--------|-------------|-----------|------|
| Create workspace | `create {action:"workspace"}` | args:{name, org_id?} — new top-level workspace; you become admin | safe |
| Create folder | `create {action:"folder"}` | workspace_id, args:{name}, parent_id? | safe |
| Rename | `edit {action:"resource.update"}` | resource_id, args:{name} | safe |
| Change icon | `edit {action:"resource.update"}` | resource_id, args:{icon} — emoji **or** `lucide:<name>` | safe |
| Set metadata | `edit {action:"resource.update"}` | resource_id, args:{metadata} — structured JSON on the resource; **replaces wholesale** ({} clears) | safe |
| Upload file | `create {action:"file"}` | workspace_id, args:{name, content_base64, mime_type?}, parent_path? | safe |
| Download / read a file | `read {action:"file"}` | resource_id, args:{format?} — signed URL by default, base64 for small files | safe |
| Ask/notify workspace members | `message {action:"members"/"send"/"read"}` | workspace_id, args:{content, require_response?} | visible to workspace |
| Move | `edit {action:"resource.move"}` | resource_id, args:{new_parent_path}, insert_after_id? | safe |
| Delete (archive) | `edit {action:"resource.delete"}` | resource_id | ⚠️ **confirm** — soft, recoverable |
| Add tags | `edit {action:"resource.tag"}` | resource_id, args:{tag_names[], create_missing?} — `create_missing:true` creates any tags that don't exist yet | safe |
| Remove tags | `edit {action:"resource.untag"}` | resource_id, args:{tag_names[]} | ⚠️ destructive |
| Share by email | `share {action:"user"}` | resource_id, args:{email, role?} | ⚠️ visible to others |
| Set public access | `share {action:"public"}` | resource_id, args:{public_access} | ⚠️ **confirm** — visible publicly |

### Resource icons (any resource type)

`edit {action:"resource.update", resource_id, args:{icon}}` accepts either an **emoji** or a
**Lucide icon** as `lucide:<kebab-name>` (e.g. `lucide:rocket`, `lucide:file-text`). Unlike the
old surface, this works on **any** resource type — documents, tables, artifacts, and folders.

### Resource metadata (structured JSON)

`edit {action:"resource.update", resource_id, args:{metadata}}` stores an arbitrary JSON object
on the resource — e.g. classifying a doc as an API endpoint:

```
edit {action:"resource.update", resource_id, args:{metadata:{
  kind:"api_endpoint", http_method:"GET", path:"/api/v1/credits", scope:"credit:read"
}}}
```

It **replaces** the whole metadata object (not a merge) — send the complete object each time;
`{}` clears it. Metadata is a property of the **resource**, so every `create` action —
`doc`, `table`, `artifact`, `folder`, and `file` (upload) — also accepts `args.metadata` to
set it at creation time.

### `resource.move` path format

- Root: `"/"` or `""` or omit `new_parent_path`
- Into a folder: `new_parent_path:"/<folderId>"` (use the folder's short or full ID)
- Ordering: combine with top-level `insert_after_id` to place after a specific sibling; omit to place at the top

### Batch Operations

For "clean up my workspace":

1. `find {action:"resources", workspace_id}` → show current tree
2. Propose a reorganization plan (which folders to create, where each resource goes)
3. **Get user confirmation** before executing
4. Execute: `create {action:"folder"}` first, then `edit {action:"resource.move"}` per item, then `edit {action:"resource.tag"}`
5. Show final tree

### Uploads & downloads

- `create {action:"file"}` expects bytes as base64 or a `data:...;base64,...` URL in
  `args.content_base64`, never a local path.
- For a normal file resource, pass `workspace_id`, `args:{name, content_base64}`, and optional
  `parent_path`.
- For an image that will be inserted into a document, set `args:{inline_image: true}`; the returned
  `node` or `url` can be used with `edit {action:"doc.edit"}` (an `insert` op).
- To read a file resource back, `read {action:"file", resource_id}` returns a signed URL by
  default (base64 for small files); pass `args:{format:"base64"}` to force inline bytes.

### New workspaces

`create {action:"workspace", args:{name, org_id?}}` spins up a **new top-level workspace** (you
become its admin). Pass `org_id` to create it under an Organization you belong to; omit it for a
Personal workspace. This is a global action — a workspace-scoped connector can't call it.

### Pitfalls

- `edit {action:"resource.delete"}` is a soft delete (`is_archived = true`), so resources don't
  actually disappear — it still returns a `confirm_token` you must echo back, so confirm intent first
- `edit {action:"resource.update"}` `icon` now applies to **any** resource type (emoji or `lucide:<name>`)
- Share needs **admin or editor** role on the workspace
- Public share levels: `view | comment | edit | none`; user-level roles: `viewer | commenter | editor | admin`
- `share {action:"public"}` requires confirmation (echo the `confirm_token`) — it exposes the resource publicly
- When sharing, always confirm the target email address before calling

## Cross-Skill Follow-Ups

- After browsing, user may want to `read {action:"doc"}` or edit → route to `dokki-document`
- After search, user may want to read full content → route to `dokki-document`
- After asking for approval, use `message {action:"read"}` before executing the approved action
- After organizing, user may want to publish → route to `dokki-publish`
